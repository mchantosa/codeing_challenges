What is a graph? A graph is a collection of vertices and edges
What is a vertex? Set of nodes/labels
What is an edge?  A pair of vertices

Directed graphs
connected graphs
cycles
An directed graph, connected, with no cycles is a tree

Famous graph problems
  - Shortest path?
  - Longest path?
  - Cycles in a graph
  - Topological sort: (Directed, no cycle) === DAG
      - An ordering of nodes where the previous nodes are always parents or grandparents of the next nodes
          - Kahn's Algorithm
          - DFS
  - connected components
      - Union find
  - Network flow (more advanced, got to know about)
  - Matching
  - Min cut problem
  - Dijkstra
  - Bellman-Ford
  - Tavern sales person

  BFS: shortest path
  DFS: does a path exist or all paths
