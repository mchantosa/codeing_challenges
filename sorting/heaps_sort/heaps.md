# Heaps

Two types of heaps, min and max

* Min heap: root is always minimal, left child is less than right child
* Max heap: root is maximal, left child is always greater than right child

If you extract the root, the datastructure will have to replace the root, this process has a time complexity of log(N) where N is the size of the heap.

## Complexity

* **Time complexity:** Nlog(N)
* **Space complexity:**
